        <h1> Parasitology and Entomology </h1>
        <h2> <strong>Parasitology </strong> </h2>
        <p> Parasitology is the study of parasites. <b> Parasites</b> are living organisms that are associated with food for all or part of their life cycle. The organism that provides the food is the <b> Host</b>.</p>
        <p> Parasites have to adapt to 2 environments. The environments are:
            <ol>
                <li> Micro environment: the habitat within the host that surrounds the parasite.</li>
                <li> Macro environment: the hosts habitat.</li>
            </ol>
            parasites are often described according to which site they inhabit; that is:
            <ol>
                <li>Intracellular/Inside the membrane of the host cells.They are mostly microscopic.</li>
                <li>Extracellular/Outside the cell but within the body fluids or the matrix of tissues and organs.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p> <i> <b> Francesco Redi</b></i> is consisdered as the grandfather of Parasitology. He first described the <i> liver fluke(fasciola).</i></p>
        <h2> <strong> Entomology</strong></h2>
        <p> Entomology is the study of insects.<b> Insects</b> are a group of animals that display a tremendous variety when it comes to their appearance.
        Insects have their body divided into 3;
          <ol>
            <li>Head</li>
            <li> Thorax</li>
            <li> Abdomen</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p> <br> insects have a common characteristic feature, which includes:
            <ul>
                <li> They have 3 pairs of legs</li>
                <li> body is divided into 3</li>
                <li> most of them possess wings</li>
                <li> have a pair of compound eyes usually accompanied by 2 or 3 simple eye called <i> ocelli</i></li>
                <li> a pair of antennae</li>
            </ul>
           NOTE: we study insects is for the following reasons:
           <ol>
            <li> They eat our crops</li>
            <li> They eat up stored food</li>
            <li> They cause diseases</li>
            <li> They maim or kill our livestock</li>
            <li> They annoy us</li>
           </ol>
